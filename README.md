# Steganography_Python
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.
This Project basically accepts an image file and a message and encodes it into the image. Likewise, it also decodes the message from the image. The Image distortion is very minimum and the message is totally hidden in the image. This Project was done during My Second Year in MIT School of Engineering, MIT ADTU.
## Installation
1. Install Python3
2. Install PILLOW or PIL using pip
3. Install PyQt5 using pip
4. Install Font Veni.zip
